# RecommendAdventure

A trip recommendation app, based on neural network technology,
written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [Rocket](https://rocket.rs).
Locations are currently hardcoded to locations in Melbourne CBD and Clayton.
Developed at UniHack Mini 2018, Monash University.

## Prerequisites

The latest nightly version of Rust and Rocket
is required for the app to compile and operate properly.

## Installation

Clone the repo, then

```bash
cargo build
```

at the root folder.

## Execution

### Neural Model generation

The neural model can be generated by

```bash
cargo run --bin gen
```

which will generate an initial, usable neural model from scratch.
Each generated neural model will be stored at the `neural_networks/` folder.
Ensure that `results.rs` and `training.rs` points to the correct neural model filename.

### Application

The application can be served by running

```bash
cargo run --bin rocket
```

The app will be served at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Training mode

> WARNING: Make sure that there are (at least) two model files at the `neural_networks/` folder before doing the training mode. Also ensure that the `neural_training_completion` function points to correct model paths.

After running the application server, the training mode can be initiated at `http://localhost:8000/training`.
